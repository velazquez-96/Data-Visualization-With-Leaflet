# Visualizing data with Leaflet

The script presented is focused on generating a map that plots two things. The first one is all of the earthquakes from the last 7 days based on their longitude and latitude. And the second, the tectonic plates to illustrate the relationship between these two variables.

The dataset from the tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates> and the data from the earthquakes is at [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page.
